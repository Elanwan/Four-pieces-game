# Blazor Connect Four Game

## Overview
This is a **Blazor**-based web application that implements a **Connect Four** game. The game allows two players to take turns placing pieces on the board until one player wins or the game ends in a tie. It leverages **Blazor Server** for real-time interactivity.

## Features
- **Interactive Game Board**: Players can click on columns to drop game pieces.
- **Real-time Updates**: The game updates dynamically using **Blazor's interactive rendering**.
- **Turn-based Play**: The game state tracks player turns.
- **Win Detection**: Automatically detects and announces the winner.
- **Error Handling**: Prevents illegal moves, such as placing pieces in a full column.
- **Game Reset**: Provides a reset button to start a new match.
